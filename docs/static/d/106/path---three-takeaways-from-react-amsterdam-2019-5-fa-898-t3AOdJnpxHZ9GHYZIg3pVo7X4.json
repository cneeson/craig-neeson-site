Kent explained that if we really wanted to level-up our React skills, the best way is to take some of the more common abstractions and look under the hood. The best example given was the thick layer of syntactic sugar that JSX provides us. Understanding how the compiler will eventually convert these JSX expressions into normal Javascript function calls can help us to debug our code alot faster. To this same point, Kent theorises that one of the best ways that we can learn anything in programming is to rebuild a familiar tool from scratch, not anything as arbitrary as a Todo app, but something more utility-based, like lodash. Ultimately the concept of writing a tool from scratch in this instance is purely academic, with the overall goal being to learn something new.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \" On a similar note, \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://mxstbr.com/\"\n  }), \"Max Stoiber\\u2019s\"), \" \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://youtu.be/4KfAS3zrvX8?t=17559\"\n  }), \"talk\"), \" dealt with some of the bad decisions made while architecting his newest product \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://spectrum.chat/\"\n  }), \"Spectrum\"), \". Max explained that one of the more damaging decisions made was to write areas of the stack from scratch when they shouldn\\u2019t have been. The two most time-consuming and stressful examples were a custom SSR (Server Side Rendering) engine, and a custom WYSIWYG text editor. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \" Max emphasises that naivety played a part in deciding to write both from scratch and in the case of the WYSIWYG editor, a simple markdown conversion package was just as effective. In the case of this production application, it made a lot more sense to go with hardened technologies, whose authors have already been through the pains of bug-catching and extensive user-testing. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \" An obvious takeaway is that we should evaluate technology decisions for a production stack in a vastly different way than for side projects. There is value in taking the time to write tools for ourselves if we want to level up our skills, but be wary of taking on this task for the wrong reasons.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"The continued desire for better communication between developers and designers.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"An interesting secondary tone for the conference was that of good communication.

He made a good comparison between how a developer sees a button component, and how a designer sees it. The developer sees an HTML button, with a few layers of CSS which applies their organisation\\u2019s custom interaction and styling traits. The designer sees a rect or polygon, with a text element overlayed. Andrey theorises that, if we want to truly bridge this communication gap, developers will need to start writing their code on a more primitive level, using the same terms for components like \", mdx(\"code\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"className\": \"language-text\"\n  }), \"rect\"), \", \", mdx(\"code\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"className\": \"language-text\"\n  }), \"polygon\"), \" and \", mdx(\"code\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"className\": \"language-text\"\n  }), \"text\"), \" in the same way that React Native does. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Andrey mentions a tool called \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://github.com/brainly/html-sketchapp\"\n  }), \"html-sketchapp\"), \" which allows for React components written in this manner to be imported into a designer\\u2019s Sketch instance. This would be the ultimate goal, the actual Sketch shapes and symbols would be generated from React JSX and props, but at the cost of more complex and bloated code.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Mark\\u2019s \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orPcyJMJh7Y\"\n  }), \"talk \\u2018Designing with React\\u2019\"), \" explores the idea that design systems are all about bridging the divide between design and development. React components essentially allow developers to create their own domain specific languages, using terms and phrases that make sense specifically for their organisation. Mark mentions that we should be striving to get our components to a point where they are intuitive enough for designers to use them to create mockups. Mark and his company have developed an excellent tool called \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom\"\n  }), \"Playroom\"), \", which can be used as a component library REPL. It allows anyone to start typing intellisense-enabled JSX to build a layout using the library\\u2019s components.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The combination of both talks one after another highlight a drive for consistency of terminology and workspaces for developers and designers alike.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Hooks are here to stay and can replace many patterns such as HOCs and render props\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"One of the more pervasive topics of every talk was the relatively new Hooks API.

And their attractive benefits of a lighter bundle and more readable code-base come at the expense of some re-architecting, but I think everyone agrees that this is a refactor worth taking on.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Worth Attending?\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"ReactAmsterdam is absolutely worth attending.
