                    <H2>About</H2>
                    <P size="sm">
                        Experienced front-end developer with a demonstrated history of contributing to projects used by
                        a global user-base. Specialising in React, Vue and TypeScript, enjoys working with diverse teams
                        to create the best possible products for users to enjoy and the cleanest possible code for
                        developers to maintain.
                    </P>

                    <H2>Frontend</H2>
                    <P size="sm">
                        Working on UI code is my passion in software development. I have extensive experience
                        architecting
                        and implementing UIs for the web and mobile using a variety development setups. I have a deep
                        knowledge of JavaScript/Typescript and am just as comfortable working in vanilla JS as with a UI
                        framework.
                        I have architected web projects from the ground up and enjoy working with teams to strategise
                        around solutions to some of the more challenging parts of UI design. I have experience working
                        both as an individual contributor who owns the full frontend, and also as one of many
                        team-players who all have a stake in the codebase.
                    </P>

                    <H2>Backend</H2>
                    <P size="sm">
                        I also have experience contributing to monolithic and
                        micro/service-orientated projects in C#, Java and PHP (Laravel). As much as having accurate and
                        up-to-date data contracts are important to me, I find it useful to have a surface-level
                        understanding of the code behind APIs.
                    </P>

                    <H2>Personal</H2>
                    <P size="sm">
                        In a career that is largely focused on screens, I enjoy unwinding in the evening by listening to
                        music and (attempting) to play a bit of guitar. I also try to get into the outdoors as much as
                        possible by running and exercising. I am a techy at heart though, and will often have a few
                        unfinished side-projects to tinker with too.
                    </P>
